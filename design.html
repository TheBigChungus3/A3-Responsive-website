            <p>
                These rare surviving catalogues and invitation were designed by Gordon Andrews who designed numerous David Jones gallery and other exhibition catalogues during the late 1940s.

                'Gordon Andrews: exhibition of design and craftsmanship' was Andrew's first post-WWII exhibition. Held at Margaret Jaye's gallery, 25 Rowe Street, Sydney from 5-12 November 1946, the display included exhibits of Andrews's paintings, buttons, jewellery, furniture and photography. There are photographs of the exhibition in the Gordon Andrews design archive (89/735-39).
