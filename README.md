## Rationale

Whilst the prototype created the footprint onto which the website was built, development of the website was intricate and involved a number of procedural steps, broadly outlined as follows: 
1.  Create all HTML files, CSS file and JavaScript files and collect all images
2.	Introduce base template for HTML styles.css and reset.css for all pages
3.	Create header and integrate header navigation titles
4.	Integrate placeholder text into body
5.	Styling typography of headings and body (undertaken with placeholder text) through fonts family 
6.	Styling header and integrate header navigation and logo/title
7.	Add links to all pages to support user navigation across the site
8.	Review header styling and extend development to account for mobile site width, changing this render to accommodate hamburger menu (for phone rendering)
9.	Integrate footer and replace placeholder copy with final body content
10.	Styling of footer
11.	Incorporate mobile size requirements to the footer to allow for vertical rendering
12.	Style body and image to suit desktop and mobile render
13.	Styling of secondary pages and integration of content
14.	Change layout of secondary pages to account for integration of images
15.	Finalise styling for all pages
16.	Final quality review
17.	Integrate all content into the index.html page (home page)
18.	Styling of header and footer 
19.	Changed maximum width from 820 pixels to allow the header change to accommodate a new hamburger menu and the footer items to stack vertically


In the process of building the website, there were a number of elements applied to simplify the build and subsequent use/editing of the site. These included:
- different tags to structure different sections. Tags used included “divs”; “aside”
- a nav UL (unordered list) with LI (list items) inside the UL, were used to create the site header navigation and footer 
- wrappers were applied to ensure the foundation design framework was retained to support consistency across pages and content on the site
- ID and classes were applied to specific tags to support simplified editing across pages and sections


Whilst working through the development of the website, there were a number of items that worked very well and some that were not as expected.
One of the primary issues that did consume an excessive amount of time was the creation and functionality of the hamburger menu. 
After having spent a significant amount of time on this functionality, I managed to resolve the issues by research and help from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=dAIVbLrAb_U).
Whilst the hamburger menu functionality did cause me issues, once resolved, it was also one item that I feel came together well.
Time management became an issue when working towards the deadline for submission (this was exacerbated by the fact that I had three major/final assignments due on the same date). 

One of the outcomes of this was that I was not able to integrate all of the pages as I had anticipated:
- from the primary navigation as detailed in the prototype, “Architecture” and “Art” were omitted because time ran out to source and integrate related content. 
- a lack of time to research and complete items from the footer (of the prototype) also had to be removed from the build of the website. These included – Graphic Design 
    - Industrial Design
    - Painting
    - Sculpture
    - Photography
    - Australian History
